What is LitecoinDark?
----------------

LitecoinDark is a lite version of Bitcoin using scrypt as a proof-of-work algorithm.
 - 1 minute block targets
 - subsidy halves in 12813 blocks 
 - ~82 million total coins
 - 3200 coins per block
 - 5 hours retarget difficulty

What is the purpose of this fork?
--------------------------------

This cryptocurrency had an impressive hashrate from its original launch as well
as a name that seems to pay homage to Bitcoin, Litecoin, Darkcoin, and BitcoinDark.
There are some glaring issues with the codebase, along with quite a lot of room
for improvements as well as feature additions that could greatly help this
blockchain survive and thrive in todays crypty economy.

As I have not spoken with the original developer, this fork will remain unofficial
and will serve as a staging ground for some of the features I would like to see
implemented as well as features requested by the community at large.
